  This repository contains some codes that I'm making while I'm taking a [course about machine learning](https://www.udemy.com/share/101sO8BkUZclZaRXg=/).
  At this point I'm learning how to evaluate an algorithm and compare two or more of them with cross-validations and statistical hypothesis testing.
